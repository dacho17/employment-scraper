Continue with refactoring and to Typescript. I need new eyes
1. Check out the remaining pages for the last time and make ad scrapers for ones for which I can


3. Make the code generic, there is a lot of shared functionalities. Divide responsibilities.
4. Make the solution interactive with multiple Databases through interface or sth 
5. Create Jobdetail scrapers!
6. Consider how to structure the database better - what are the commonalities? shared properties between ads?
7. Dockerize the application
8. Build a client???

npx eslint . --ext .ts
    - runinng the linter to check .ts files
