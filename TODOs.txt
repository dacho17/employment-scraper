Continue with refactoring and to Typescript. I need new eyes
0. Get rid of the magic values. Make a designated constants file.
1. Rewrite the solution in Typescript
2. Structure the solution in 3 layers - DataLayer, ServiceLayer, Controller/Router Layer
3. Make the code generic, there is a lot of shared functionalities. Divide responsibilities.
4. Make the solution interactive with multiple Databases through interface or sth 
5. Consider how to structure the database better - what are the commonalities? shared properties between ads?
6. Dockerize the application
7. Build a client???
